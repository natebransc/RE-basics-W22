<h1>Basics of Reverse Engineering Winter 2022</h1>

<p>Dartmouth CS69.16 "Basics of Reverse Engineering" course materials will be available in this public repository.

<p><a href="syllabus-draft.pdf">Draft syllabus</a>. Please note that this is <b>draft</b>. 
Although the focus and pre-requisites of the course will not change, week-by-week topics and activities will likely go though several rounds of changes, to accommodate student backgrounds and requests.

<p>This is a brand-new course, in a rapidly changing technical field. We'll be experimenting and adjusting course materials as we go.
