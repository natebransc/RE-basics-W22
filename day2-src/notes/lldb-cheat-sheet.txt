How to translate between LLDB and GDB: http://lldb.llvm.org/lldb-gdb.html 

E.g.:
- to disasm a function, in LLDB you say 

    "disas -n func_name"

Ex.:  "disas -n main" or "disas -n puts";

- to view registers, 

    "reg r", 

- to write 4 bytes memory into memory,

    "mem w -s 4 addr value"

Breakpoints and single-instruction stepping work approximately the
same as in GDB, with the difference that GDB breaks past the function
preamble, while LLDB breaks before it, and you need to step through
these to get the right value of the base pointer RBP and stack pointer
ESP.
